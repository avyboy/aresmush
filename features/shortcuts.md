Ares is new and different, but many of its players have been MUSHing for years.  Ares is designed to cater to them, too, through the **Shortcuts** system.   So if you're used to doing things a certain way - try it.  Chances are it'll still work on Ares.

# Command Names

Some Ares commands are named differently, like 'profile' instead of 'finger'.  There are shortcuts to allow the familiar commands to work as you'd expect.

# Different Parameters

Some Ares commands take their parameters in a different order, like the bbs post command being "board=subject/message" (the same as mail).  Shortcuts let you use the order you're already used to.

# Penn vs Tiny

Ares supports both Penn and Tiny commands for some systems, notably channels and mail.  So whether you like @chan/join or addcom, hopefully you'll be content.
