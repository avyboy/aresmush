> **This description is a draft for a system that does not yet exist.  It's still a work in progress and subject to change.**

The **Handles** system is a major feature that differentiates AresMUSH from its Penn and Tiny cousins.

# What are Handles?

Handles are an experiment in social media for MUSHing.  A handle is your **OOC** identity.  It represents you, the player.  You can **link** characters to your handle - even across multiple games - so that other players know who you are.

# But why?

There are some MU sub-communities where the players all know each other, and every time a new game opens there's a mad scramble to reconnect with old friends and figure out who everybody is.  Wouldn't it be nice if the game provided tools to help you do that?

Also, anyone who's been MUSHing for a long time has probably seen bbposts like:  "Looking for SoAndSo from SuchAndSuchMUSH."  Games close, people drift.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a system that made it easier to find each other and stay in touch?

Lastly, there's something to be said for being identifiable as a *player* and not just as your character(s).  Staff members already have that to a degree, wouldn't it be nice if everyone could?  

# But what if I don't *want* people to know who I am?

Some people value their privacy; we get that.  Handles are completely optional.  If you don't have one, you won't be able to access some of Ares' cool new features, but you will still be able to use all the basic MUSH features, just like on Penn/Tiny.

There are also a whole bunch of privacy settings, which we'll get into more later.

# What do handles do?

Having a handle enables numerous features. Most can be limited by your privacy settings.  See "Privacy" below for more info.

* You can choose to be identified by your handle in addition to your character name in OOC forums (pages, channels, who list).
* You can easily synchronize some of the OOC game settings (like timezone, autospacing, etc.) across all of your characters, instead of having to set them over and over.
* The game can do little things like notifying you when another alt gets new mail, or marking a bbpost as read for all alts once you've read it.
* You can page someone as their handle name in addition to their character name.
* You can see when a friend connects/disconnects no matter which alt they log in with.
* You can look up a handle to find out where else they play, to help you keep in touch with your friends.

Someday, handles might tie into more cross-game features, like being able to page people on different games (anyone remember MUDBot?)

# What about my privacy?

The handles system includes a number of privacy settings, which tie into the AresMUSH friends system.  

Handles are completely optional.  The most extreme privacy setting is simply to avoid the system altogether.

Even if you have a handle, you get to choose which characters to link to it.  So if you don't want anyone knowing you're playing on KinkyMUSH, just leave that character unlinked.

Even if you link characters to your handle, you get to choose who can see that link.  When someone looks at your handle profile, will they see that character?  When someone looks at that character, will they see your handle?  This setting is **per-character**.

* Public - Everyone can see this character linked to your handle.
* Friends-Only - Only designated friends will see this character linked to your handle.
* Admin-Only - Only game admin will see this character linked to your handle.   AresMUSH.com website admin(s) are bound by our [Privacy Policy]({{site.siteroot}}/privacy.html) and will not misuse your handle information.  Game admins are not, so remember, the only truly private character is one who is not linked to your handle at all.

# How do I get a handle?

You sign up for a handle on the AresMUSH.com website.  Handles are globally unique, which is just another way of saying there can only be one "@Faraday" across all AresMUSH games.
