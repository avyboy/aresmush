Ares tries to make players' lives easier.  Most of these are little conveniences, but hopefully they add up to a more pleasurable experience overall.  

* Command output is prefixed with '%%' so you can easily strip it out of logs.

        %% You set the description on Faraday.

* A better AFK system that lets you easily specify an idle message and warns people when you're really idle. (help afk)

        Players:
        Faraday <Idle>
        
        %% Faraday is 3h idle and may be AFK.
    
* A save/recall command to stash a pose you're working on to answer a page or some other distraction. (help recall)

* Insert blank lines or other text between poses to track them more easily. (help autospace)

* An IC/OOC status system driven by where you are, rather than an arbitrary setting, to keep people from getting stuck OOC.  (help status)

* Meetme multiple people at once. (help meetme)

* 'Do not disturb' page setting, which converts incoming pages to mails. (help page)

* mail/new that works similar to 'bbnew' to read new mail messages one by one. (help mail)

* Edit commands (like desc/edit) that grab text easily into your client's input buffer (kind of like /grab or @dec).

And for admins...

* Staff member on/off duty status tied in with the status system. (help duty)

* Teleport to a person or place by name or ID. (help teleport)

* *More coming eventually*
