# Start the Game

Now you're ready to start the game for real.  From your [MUSH server shell]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/server-connect.html), type:

    cd aresmush (if you aren't there already)
    bin/startares

> The important difference between 'devstart' and 'startares' is that the latter will continue to run even after you log off.  That is what you want to use for normal operation.

# Next Step

The next step is to [Customize the Game]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/customize-game.html)
