Here are step-by-step instructions for setting up Ares with [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/), a cloud hosting service for MongoDB.

> Note:  These instructions and screenshots were current as of the time of this writing, but MongoLab can change their interface at any time.  If you have trouble figuring out the install options, don't hesitate to [Get Help]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/getting-help.html).

1. Create a MongoLab account.  

2. Click 'Create New' to create a new db.

3. Choose the options for your db.

    * Choose a provider you like (it doesn’t matter).
    * Choose a location close to your MU* server (if you know, if not don't worry too much).
    * Choose “single-node’ plan.
    * Choose 'sandbox (free)'.
    * Enter a db name, like  "mymush_db".

4. Back at the dashboard, select your new db.

5. You should see an alert telling you to create a user.  Click on that to create a user so the MUSH can talk to the dabase.  Don't use the same user and password as your MongoLab account for security reasons.
 
    Note: This same screen also shows you the hostname information, which you will need later when configuring the MUSH.

6. If you want multiple database admins, you can create a second account user under Account -> Account Users -> Add Account User.  Give that person their own username and password, and they'll be able to log in and manage the database too.

You're all set!   You will need the username, password, db name and hostname when configuring Ares, so make a note of them.
