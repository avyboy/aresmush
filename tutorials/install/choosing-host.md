# Choosing a Host

Although you can run AresMUSH on your desktop or laptop for code development and test purposes, that's really not the ideal way to run a game.  You need a place to host it - a server.  

> Note:  These tutorials assume you're hosting the game on a Linux system, since that's what 99% of MU hosts and servers are.  Someday the documentation will probably include instructions for a Windows install too.

# Server Requirements

There are many MUSH hosts out there, but their packages are geared toward PennMUSH and TinyMUX.  Ares needs a few additional things, namely **Ruby** and **Git**.  

## Finding a Turnkey Host

Here is a list of MU hosts that are known to offer Ares-compatible hosting packages with Ruby and Git already installed:  

**TODO:  None yet, contact Faraday for installation help**

> *Note!* This is not meant to be an endorsement of any particular host.

## Setting Up Your Own Host

If you have another host willing to help you out, or if you have admin rights on a machine, you can check out [Advanced Server Setup]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/install/server-setup.html) for instructions on setting up Ruby and Git.

# Next Step

Now that you have a host, the next step is to [Connect to the Server]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/install/server-connect.html)
