## Source Control

To code for Ares, I highly recommend using GitHub for your source control, as explained in [Advanced Coder Setup]]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials/coder-setup.html).

Using source control keeps a history of the changes you make, serves as an automatic backup system, and makes it easier to sync your changes with future Ares upgrades.  It can even work for multiple coders (but it can get a bit complicated if they're changing the same stuff).

Source control is awesome.

Source control also lets you code on your local PC.  It's much more convenient than editing things on the server, and you can test things out before you put them up on the real game.

    GitHub --> Your PC --> make changes and test them --> GitHub --> MU Server
